Dedication:

This project is dedicated to Dr. Walter S. Nosal, Ph.D.; coal mining Jerome, PA native, professor, husband, (great/grand-) father, psychologist, athlete, Roman Catholic, writer, dancer, and wanderer (and probably a lot of other things I never knew about). To me he is the original Rambler who didn’t have a car, but hitchhiked the whole way.

This project is also dedicated to Joseph Martin O’Toole, Sr.; Pittsburgh, PA Jones & Laughlin Steel Co. locomotive engineer, union organizer, husband, (great/grand-) father, Roman Catholic, and neighbor (and probably a lot of other things I never knew about).

These two men are my grandfathers. In considering a few of the qualities that are possible in a man (such as the ones listed above), I like to think that, probably among other things, I am a pretty decent combination of these two separate and different, but equal, people.
